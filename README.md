# HappyBirthdayAutomated
Turn my phone into a server and autoSMS happy birthday let's gooooo

<br>

Posting "Happy birthday" on FB is too slow and I don't want to login everyday just to say happy birthday boooo

With this app: the user saves the names and phone numbers of friends. Each day, the phone will get that day's date and 
check if any of the contacts saved have birthdays on that day. If yes, the phone will <strong>automatically SMS that contact</strong> a happy
 birthday message. If not, we will check again tomorrow :))))))
